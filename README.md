3D Reconstruction Project
This project involves estimating 3D structures from a series of 13 images. The core functionalities include calculating the camera matrix using calibration photos, testing the rotation matrices and translation vectors, and generating 3D points.

Project Structure
MainCode.py: This is the main script that estimates the 3D structure from 13 images located in the images/SFM Photos folder. Run this script to see the results of the 3D reconstruction.

CAMERAMAT.py: This script calculates the camera matrix using photos from the calibration folder. It is a crucial component for camera calibration, which is necessary for accurate 3D reconstruction.

cameraPositionT.py: This script tests the calculated rotation matrices and translation vectors by comparing them with actual matrices obtained through physical measurements. The test photos are located in the images/Test directory.

PointCloud.py: This file contains the 3D points generated by the code. It stores the final output of the 3D reconstruction process.

Running the Project
Run MainCode.py: To execute the main 3D reconstruction process and visualize the results, simply run the MainCode.py script.
bash
Copy code
python MainCode.py
Dependencies: Ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed. You can install them using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Folder Structure
images/SFM Photos: Contains the 13 images used for the 3D reconstruction process.
calibration: Contains the calibration photos needed for calculating the camera matrix.
images/Test: Contains the test images used in cameraPositionT.py to validate the rotation matrices and translation vectors.
Additional Information
Ensure that all images are correctly placed in their respective directories before running the scripts.
Modify the paths in the scripts if your folder structure is different.
